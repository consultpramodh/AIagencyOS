# UI/UX Design Rules (Non-Negotiable)

## Product IA Rules

- Dashboard (`/`) is one-glance only: priorities, risks, due work, approvals, and live operational signal.
- Detailed execution must live on dedicated pages (clients/projects/tasks/notes/scheduler/calendar/crm/workflows/brainstorm/connectors/mobile).
- Navigation must be stable and predictable across all pages.

## UX Rules

- Every screen answers one primary user question.
- Primary action appears once per section and is visually obvious.
- Keep forms compact and progressive (minimal required fields first).
- Use keyboard-friendly controls and clear focus states.
- Avoid visual noise: no dense multi-purpose cards.
- Empty states must be explicit and action-oriented.

## Visual System Rules

- Use shared tokens for spacing, color, radius, elevation.
- Use semantic color meaning consistently:
  - Trust (blue): system status, stable operations
  - Focus (indigo): active work, selected workflows
  - Attention (amber): pending approvals, due work
  - Success (teal/green): completed/healthy outcomes
  - Risk (rose/red): blocked/failed/urgent
- Pastel backgrounds are allowed, but text and actions must remain high-contrast.
- Card hierarchy: headline > supporting context > action.

## Business-Positive Color Theory

- Default sentiment should feel calm, capable, and forward-moving.
- Reserve warm attention hues for priority items only.
- Avoid excessive red; use it only for explicit risk/failure states.
- Keep call-to-action color consistent to build decision confidence.
